# Obsidian Cheat Sheet
## Markdown basics
Headers: use ‘# ’ (pound space)
• Level 1 header: #
• Level 2 header: ##
• …
• Level 6 header: ######
Tags are words with a ‘#’ in front, with no space between the ‘#’ and the word: 
To make text bold, surround it with ‘**’s:
This **word** is important. → This word is important.
To make text italic, surround it with ‘_’s or ‘*s’.
_This is_ kind of *important*. → This is kind of important.
Bullet lists: use ‘- ‘ (notice the space after the dash).
- one
- two
Use numbers (1.) instead for numbered lists.
A checklist is with ‘- [ ]’ (dash space [ space ]).
## Linking
To create a link to a webpage:
[text for the link](https://example.com/)
To link to a page in your vault (create a local link):
[[Resources/some page]]
To link to a header in your vault (another local link):
[[Resources/some page#Header]]
To change the text for a local link: use the | character:
[[Resources/some page|this will show up instead]]
